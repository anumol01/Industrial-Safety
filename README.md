# 🔐 Industrial Safety and Access Control System (STM32F405 + FreeRTOS)

## 📖 Overview
This project is a real-time embedded system developed using the STM32F405 microcontroller for industrial safety monitoring and access control. It detects fire, smoke, and gas leaks via sensors and responds automatically using actuators like motors, buzzers, and LEDs. A keypad ensures secure access, and an LCD provides real-time feedback.
